## Description

SketchfabViewer is a Web Component library that allows you to manipulate the Sketchfab Viewer API simply and easily.

## Motivation

With the strong demand for 3D models on the web. Sketchfab has become an important benchmark for many reasons, one of which is connecting a 3D viewer to an iframe tag. I have personally had to work on several projects where it was necessary to implement and modify the API viewer. Hide a button, add a custom payload, custom icon, etc.
The hard part is implementing the Sketchfab client in projects with server-side rendering.ü§í
These and other common API viewer configuration errors that consume research time and cause us some headaches. This package will be handling them üëçüèª. So enjoy it üôåüèº!!!

## Getting started

### Installation

Add SketchfabViewer to your project by executing

```js
 npm install sketchfab-viewer
```

or

```js
 yarn add sketchfab-viewer
```

### Usage

Here's an example of basic usage:

- Add SketchfabViewer in HTML

```html
<sketchfab-viewer uid="538f4a91fb374937833ec025eaad5589"> </sketchfab-viewer>
```

## Alternatives

You will probably need to interact with the different options and settings provided by the Sketchfab viewer API itself. Many of the options have account limitations.
Please visit the [official site](https://sketchfab.com/developers/viewer/initialization) to know all the options and settings

having said that...

- You can control the different aspects of the model viewer by passing properties with the values allowed by the Sketchfab Viewer API

- It even allows adding any loader component by passing the slot='loader' attribute

- The same with any button that you want to add slot='button'

- Keep in mind that the component has a relative position, so you can play with the absolute position all you want.

```js
 <SketchfabViewer
    id="my-viewer"
    uid="538f4a91fb374937833ec025eaad5589"
    settings='[{"name": "getMaterialList", "arguments": []}]'
    options={autospin: 0}
 >
 <MyCustomLoader slot='loader'></MyCustomLoader>
 <Button slot='button' onClick={() => getEnv()}>Set Env</Button>
 </SketchfabViewer>

  const viewer = document.getElementById("my-viewer")
  viewer.addEventListener("onResponse", (event) => console.log(event)); // Response event for all request
  function getEnv(){
    viewer.updateSettings("setEnvironment", [{options}]) // method to use any Viewer API call
  }

```
